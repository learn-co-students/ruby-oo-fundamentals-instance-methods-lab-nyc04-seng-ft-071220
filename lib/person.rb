class Person
  def talk
    puts "Hello World!"
  end
  
  def walk 
    puts "The Person is walking"
  end
  
end

# notes same as you did in "doc class , create a "class" "person" and define what a person would do.
#  a person walks , and talks "some should not"! make sure to use def for every "instance method toy create this will change later"!
